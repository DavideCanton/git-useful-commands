# Git Useful Commands

Some useful git commands written in bash scripts.

Add them to a path folder to use them.

## Commands

List of commands:
- `git fall`: fetches into every local tracked branch all the commits from its upstream;
- `git cln`: removes all local branches whose remote counterpart is gone and prunes all remotes;
- `git cob`: finds a branch by a substring. Searches first in local branches, then in remote ones; if multiple matches are found, lists them and performs no checkout.
